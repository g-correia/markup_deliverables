The datasets testing_obsolete.csv and training_obsolete.csv wer extracted from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/295/urban+land+cover, where a pre-existing division into training and testing is provided. This was undone by binding both data sets together again, resulting in the raw_data.csv dataset.
